# Luan Castheloge's portifolio
Hi, I am a computer engineering graduated by Universidade Federal do Espirito Santo (UFES) at Brazil.
Data is everything nowadays and transform then in information make me exciting!
I started to study data science in June 2017 and this repository is to help anyone else that wants to understand this huge and amazing role.  
So letâ€™s explore!

## How this repository is organized?
I organized this portfolio by python tests, data analysis, and machine learning examples. After that, I put all my small projects separated by the used technics. In these small projects, I used some dataset or image taken from the web.
My approach is to show my skills through direct and objective practices about data science.


### Applications with some libraries ( :open_file_folder: libraries_applications)
These libraries (**Numpy, Panda and Seaborn**) are that I most like to use. They are so powerful and attend all my need for this portfolio.
In this folder, I show how to use some functionalities that helped me to create my projects.


### Data analysis ( :open_file_folder: data_analysis)
When I think about Data analysis, I immediately think about processes/subprocesses like: a process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, inferring conclusions and supporting decision-making.

#### Titanic Analysis
The Titanic analysis is a classic application to transform all these data in some information. In my algorithm, I check the relation about the type of cabin and age of passengers.
First of all, I fitted the date replacing my null values for the average of ages. Second I checked my data and results with a seaborn chart. Third I checked the relation between the sector embarked and if the passenger survived. Besides that, I did some analysis for the passengers by age, if they were responsible for someone and the fare.
Finally, I did a linear regression to the age and a possibility that the passenger survived.


### Machine Learning ( :open_file_folder: machine_learning_examples)

#### K-Nearest-Neighbors
#### Linear regression
#### Natural language processing (NLP)
#### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
#### Support Vector Machines
#### Neural Network
